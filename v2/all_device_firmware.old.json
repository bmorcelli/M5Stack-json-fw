    "name": "2 Player Tilt Pong! For BOTH M5StickC Plus1 & Plus2",
    "description": "The original Pong was created in 1972 by Allan Alcorn, working for Atari Inc. It was released on November 29, 1972. And now you can play against your friends again today in 2025. Who needs flying cars?\n*Requires 2 M5Sticks - Plus1 Plus2 OR one of each.\nAnd a friend. \n\nTo play.  \nAfter burning the software to both devices. Start one up before the other! Or they won't sync. \n\nOn the first device, It will boot to the calibrate screen. It says press A, actually press M5. Its just a typo I forgot to fix from programming.\n\nWait for it to look for a Host, after a few seconds of not finding a Host it will create one. When it says Host: Waiting start your second device.\nIt will then connect via WiFi as a Client.  \n\nThen it starts fast! Tilt left to make paddle go UP tilt right to make paddle go DOWN. \n\nThat's it! I only had one of each device when testing, so I have not tried to connect two of the same devices, but it should be universal. \nThe sound does not turn off. My bad. But its not too loud.  \n\nI know. I cannot take a good picture if my life depended on it.\nHave fun with your blast from the past!\n\nThis is a 2 player tilt Pong created from the source code by freedomxxjustice \n\nModified by Coreymillia\n\nFor BOTH M5StickC Plus1 & M5StickC Plus2! First multi device compatible, 2 player firmware I have made.  Seemed like a good place to start. \n",

    "description": "Bruce firmware with Shark-Bait - WiFi Defence Firmware\n\nShark-Bait is a WiFi defense firmware for the M5StickC Plus, designd to detect and disrupt nearby threats in real time. It's built on the Bruce firmware foundation and inspired by the expressive security monitoring style of Evil Cardputer. The device scans for suspisious networks, visualizes threats with color-coded feedback, and deploys countermeasures like Karma and Evil Twin attacks. Pressing any button halts the operation instantly. \n\nThis firmware blends practical mesh defense with expressive payload broadcasting. It's meant for ethical testing, educational use, and showcasing how compact hardware can respond to hostile environments with style. \n\nSome Bruce features removed to make everything fit. \nUntouched-\nWiFi\nBle\nIr\nFM\nRF\n\nCredit to Bruce firmware by @pr3y and team, and to Evil Cardputer for inspiring the monitoring philosophy. \n\nOnly works on M5Stickc Plus ---  for now...

You can just wire it yourself with the jumper wires according to the module pinout. Attach signal pin to G1 pin of the GROVE port. And you need the SD card to be inserted into the Cardputer so the app could store commands from your remote.\n============================\nSupported IR protocols\nAll that IRRemote library supports\n============================\nCurrent features\nRead signals from your remote. (All of that you read is stored in the array for the later send and limited to 42 entries).\nSend signals that were read before.\nCopy your remote to the SD card folder\nLoad copied remote from the SD card\nCheck Cardputer battery status\nSettings (currently empty)",

    "description": "Drumputer User Manual   https://youtu.be/KHAryvxbX6w\nDrumputer is a drum machine and sequencer program for the M5Cardputer device. It allows you to create, edit, and play drum patterns with up to 4 instruments and 16 , 32 steps.\n   Main Interface\n- The grid shows 4 rows (instruments) and 16 or 32 columns (steps).\n- Numbers on the left (1-4) represent instruments.\n- Numbers on top represent steps (1-16 or 1-32).\n- Filled squares indicate active steps for each instrument.\n- The red cursor shows the current editing position.\n- The green bar shows the current playing step.\n\nBasic Controls\n- Use ',' and '/' keys to move the cursor left and right.\n- Press ENTER to toggle a step on/off.\n- Use keys 1-4 to select an instrument.\n- Press '0' to start/stop playback.\n- Use the up or down keys to increase/decrease BPM.\n- Press 'E' to toggle between 16 and 32-step mode.\n\n## Special Playback Modes\n- Press '5' for two-step roll mode (alternates between first two steps).\n- Press '6' for reverse playback mode.\n\n## File Management\n- Press '9' to enter/exit the WAV file selection menu.\n- In the WAV menu, use ',' and '/' to navigate, ENTER to select a file.\n- Press '7' to enter/exit the sequence management menu.\n- In the sequence menu:\n  - Use 'S' to toggle between Save and Load modes.\n  - Use 'D' to enter Delete mode.\n  - Use ',' and '/' to navigate, ENTER to perform the selected action.\n\n## Synchronization\n- The device outputs a 2 PPQ (Pulses Per Quarter Note) sync signal on pin G2 y Gnd \n- This allows synchronization with other music equipment.\n- The sync pulse is sent twice per beat, aligned with the sequencer's timing.\nTips\n- In the WAV selection menu, you can preview sounds as you navigate.\n- Saved sequences include BPM, step count, pattern, and sample assignments.\n- The 32-step mode allows for more complex patterns.\n- Use the roll and reverse modes for interesting rhythmic variations.\nThe wav files go in the root of the sd memory \nwith any name but if you rename it this way 1.wav, 2.wav, 3.wav, 4.wav\n they will sound by default on each track without selecting anything\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nWhile the Drumputer has been successfully tested with equipment such as the Korg Pocket Operator and TD-3 without issues, the creator and developer of this software do not assume any responsibility for potential damages that may occur to your equipment when using this device.\n\nThe use of the Drumputer, including its synchronization features, is at the user's own risk. Users are advised to exercise caution and ensure compatibility with their specific equipment before connecting or using the Drumputer with other devices.\n\nBy using the Drumputer, you acknowledge that you understand and accept these terms, and agree to use the device responsibly and at your own discretion.\nDrumputer was developed with the help of AI over the last month. While it has been successfully tested, it is still in development.\nKnown issue: Simultaneous playback of WAVs on a track may slow down the beat. Marketing and selling is not permitted\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "The latest updated version of ESP32Maurauder with SD Card support and some much needed changes to the on-screen menu. More features work, but there are still a few things that aren't fully operational. I was able to get PCAPs stored to the SD Card for offline cracking, so that's a start.\n\nYou have to build your own SD Card adapter to plug into the M5Stick C Plus. To wire this up, you can get any generic Arduino/esp32 SPI MicroSD slot with 6 pins. \n\nStickCPlus Header - SPI SD Card Reader\n             3v3   -   3v3\n              GND   -   GND\n               G0   -   CLK\n          G36/G25   -   MISO\n              G26   -   MOSI\n                       \nCS on the reader should be jumpered to GND\n\nKnown issues:\nRecommend using external power. When the battery voltage drops, even a little, some brands of SD Cards stop working properly and could get corrupted.\nNo touch screen, so you can only use the \"next\" key (side button) and \"select\" key (M5 button on the front) to navigate",

    "description": "PortalHater Core v2025\nTwo Modes:\n-The Ultimate Evil Portal Defense System for M5Stack CORE\n-PLUS! a STAND ALONE desk clock with 2,025 randomly shuffled Jokes/insults\n\n420 tech roast insults for data theives.\n\nPortalHater Core is a powerful ESP32-based tool designed to detect and attack evil portals (captive portal WiFi attacks) used by devices like Flipper Zero, WiFi Pineapple, and other penetration testing tools. Built for the M5Stack CORE, it features an intuitive menu system, customizable display colors, and 2,025 jokes/insults to keep you entertained.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Features\nPortal Attack Modes\nBruce Attack Mode: Sends spam packets to overwhelm WiFi Pineapple portals\nNemo Attack Mode: Targets Flipper Zero evil portals with packet flooding\nDual Attack: Can target both portal types simultaneously\nReal-time Display: Shows attack messages with animated sine wave graphics\nEntertainment Modes\n2025 Jokes/Insults: Random rotating collection of:\nTech snark\n90s playground insults\nFood-based roasts\nDevice failure messages\nAI overlord contempt\nHistorical/literary comparisons\nAbstract conceptual insults\nAnd much more!\nAuto-scroll: Adjustable from 2 seconds to 1 minute per joke\nManual Navigation: Skip jokes with button press\nCustomization\nClock Display: Time starts at 7:10 24hour format.\nDo not unplug or you will have to reset clock. And I could have made setting it a little easier. But it is not difficult. \nReal-time clock on main screen, attack, and during joke scrolling\nColor Customization:\nClock color (12 preset colors)\nJoke text color (12 preset colors)\nInsult text color for portal attacks (12 preset colors)\nBrightness Control: 16 levels from dim to maximum\nVisual Effects: Animated sine wave borders with randomized patterns\n\ud83c\udfae Controls\nButton Layout (M5Stack CORE)\nButton A (Left): Scroll up in menus / Adjust scroll time in Jokes mode / Toggle Portal Hater from main screen (you have to wait for it to stop attacking to exit back to main screen!)\nButton B (Middle): Enter menu / Select menu item / Exit current mode\nButton C (Right): Scroll down in menus / Skip to next joke / Adjust scroll time in Jokes mode\nMenu Navigation\nPortal Hater Mode: Activate WiFi attack mode\nJokes Mode: Display random jokes/insults\nSet Clock: Set current time (24-hour format)\nClock Color: Choose clock text color\nJoke Color: Choose joke text color\nInsult Color: Choose portal attack message color\nBrightness: Adjust screen brightness (16 levels)\n\nCustomizable Options\nAll settings are adjustable via the menu system and persist between uses:\n\nClock time (24-hour format)\nText colors for clock, jokes, and insults\nAuto-scroll timing (2-60 seconds)\nScreen brightness (1-16)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Legal Disclaimer\nThis tool is for educational and defensive purposes only.\n\nPortalHater Core is designed to:\n\nDemonstrate WiFi security vulnerabilities\nDefend against captive portal attacks\nInsult yourself or friends\nTest network security in controlled environments\nYou must:\n\nOnly use this tool on networks you own or have explicit permission to test\nComply with local laws and regulations regarding WiFi security testing\nNot use this tool for malicious purposes or unauthorized access\nThe developers are not responsible for any misuse of this software.\n\n\ud83d\udc1b Known Issues\nClock must be manually set each time (no RTC battery backup) and setting the clock kind of sucks, I knew about it and was done with this for now. \nBattery life is ~10 minutes when actively attacking (normal for M5Stack CORE)\nThe graphics freeze up in the attack mode. I did not try to fix. \n\nTested with Bruce and Nemo. NOT tested with a flipper zero. \n\nTruth is I really wanted a scrolling insult desk clock.  A lot of the jokes are stupid but some are pretty funny. You don't ever have to turn the Portal Hater on. \n\nAll jokes and insults generated by asking multiple AI agents what they would say to people if they could. Particularly one question asking Gemini to make some jokes about if it was an AI overlord. Pretty sure that chatbot does not like people.  With that being said there is nothing as offensive as it probably could have been.  \n\nCreated by Coreymillia\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "During testing of this I was able to crash the Evil Portal. Sends spam every 500ms. 50 packs at a time.  During all of the test, Evil Portal would crash in between 2-300 spam messages. Checking with my phone it was gone, error message, until the Evil device was restarted. \n\nThis was supposed to have a lot more features. But things did not go as planned. So we focused on the Portal Killer function. Finds any Evil portal regardless of name.  I do not know if it will work with a custom HTML, yet.  When you boot up R button navigates up. There is no down. M5 to select. \nThe screen does still say A, B and C. I probably could have fixed this easily. But... Well just letting you know. There is no C. \n\nThere are 3 choices\n-Scan for Threats-\n-Counter Attack- This is the Portal Killer\n-Shield Mode- This was taken from Bruce somewhere it was working... now it seems to do something.... but probably not much.\nTo return to menu press R\n\nThe project may get updated some day. We had a lot of features but most were less than useful. As it is it's pretty cool, and stable. You may have to rescan if the portal goes offline and back on. You shouldn't but I don't think I got that working again.\n\n The original goal, was to spam thousands of messages, and it was. But at some point it started crashing the portal, pretty fast. So that seemed even better. No guarantee it will. \n\nCreated by Coreymillia with code that may or may not be yours. I no longer know. But there is at least a little bit of team Bruce left in there I am sure. If not it was what we used for testing. ",

    "description": "This is a social parasite. For both the M5StickC Plus1 AND Plus2 unified project! \n\nTo use. \n-It has 2 functions. How you power it on, or how they meet will affect how it works. \n-If you want the parasites to chat. Power them on together. They will discover each other and start to spin around and chat in their own language of 139 words in random generated messages. \n-If you want them to attack a known Evil Portal then  you will want to power them on ONE at at time and wait for them to connect to the portal. You will know when they are attacking. \n-I got 3 to connect to one portal, each one spamming at one message @500ms per message. This caused an Evil Portal I was running to CRASH. Fast. \n-You have to restart the device to return to normal scan mode. If you are just running one hoping to run into a stranger or Evil Portal.  It will scan for both. \n-I was unable to get the tilt reaction from the original project to work... yet. \n----This was created from the Evil Parasite project by 7h30th3r0n3----\n\nModified by Coreymillia",

    "description": "Cardputer & Adv; New faster cpu emulation core('fastest' mode in cpu settings, the default unless I get incompatibilty reports). Cycle available scales using the \\ button. Change vertical scale & alignment using Fn+\\ Check back often for latest updates.\n\nGameboy Emulator; complete with configurable controls, audio, display and performance options, savegames, save states, filesystem navigation and no .gb rom file size limits imposed by memory. Various other enhancements. Accurate palettes. Partial Super Gameboy Enhancement support, including borders. Extended 12 colour mode, along with all official/original GBC palettes. 44 Analogue Pocket 12 colour community palettes included with automatic mapping of titles to AP palettes partially implemented. Pokemon Silver/Gold,  Dragon Warrior I&II and Azure dreams are the only confirmed fully supported .gbc titles, backwards compatible with the original gameboy and run in that mode. Emulator will behave as if you placed a gameboy colour cartridge into an original gameboy in most instances. Feel free to try other backwards compatible gbc games, but no garuntees on compatiblity. All *.gb and *.gbc files are listed by the file explorer in the current directory.\n\nRead the instructions at the bottom for controls. Forked from original gb_cardputer implementation. As of version 0.75 a launcher is no longer required, versions prior to that have no bootloader merged so if you are having issues try using m5launcher to install.\n\nSave states can be used by pressing the minus/underscore key to load,  and backspace/del to save.\n\nHold Fn and press the left arrow to mute audio\nHold Fn and press the right arrow to jump to 50/100% volume\nHold Fn and press the up/down arrows to change volume in smaller adjustments.\n21.11.2024:v0.79.60\n* Added initial i2c joystick support (joyv2)\n* Changed interlaced mode to default for best CGB performance\n16.11.2024:v0.79.55\n* Fixed broken sound when interlacing was not used\n14.11.2024:v0.79.54\n* Increased performance(+2fps in many games)\n* Tightened frame limiter\n* Fixed Super Mario Deluxe running extremely fast(and other titles where this issue appeared after the new cpu core was introduced)\n13.11.2024:v0.79.52\n* Full screen mode is now much faster when using interlacing(almost no impact)\n* Grand Theft Auto can now take full advantage of new architecture.\n* revised 24 opcodes to take full advantage of new cpu core architecture(temp disabled)\n12.11.2024:v0.79.50\n* new 'fastest' cpu mode(default) in settings\n* rewrote every single instruction for new cpu execution model\n5.11.2024:v0.69.41\n* overall subtle performance improvement\n* performed manual micro-optimizations to cache locality\n* performed micro-optimizations on 18 opcodes\n1.11.2024:v0.79.30\n* interlacing now provides a further performance boost\n* full screen(16:9) is now the default scaling mode, sgb borders on by default if available for a game but hidden unless scaling mode changed\n* changed default palette for new users from black&white to the gameboy pocket palette\n31.10.2025:v0.79.27\n* fixed rendering bug with centered vertical alignment\n* changed default aspect ratio to 12:10 for improved visibility\n30.10.2025:v0.79.26\n* Initial implementation of vertical scaling and alignment control, rotate through the various modes using Fn+\\\n\n29.10.2025:v0.79.25\n* Initial implementation of full screen(and other) horizontal scaling modes, rotate through various aspect ratios(including overscanned resolutions) using the \\ key\n\n28.10.2025:v0.79.22\n* fixed crash on palette changed introduced with v0.79.12\n* quick save/quick load feature now works correctly with cgb games\n27:.10.2025:v0.79.20\n* fixed save games not working or being corrupted when switching between games.\n* significantly increased the speed of Grand Theft Auto\n26.10.2025:v0.79.14\n* interlacing no longer causes screen distortion\n25.10.2025:v0.79.12\n* further performance improvements (all games,+2-4fps)\n24.10.2025:v0.79.08\n* overall performance improvement (all games)\n23.10.2025:v0.92.06\n* performance improvements \n22.10.2025:v0.92.04\n* extended cpu fast mode compatibility to include cgb\n* fixed interlacing not synchronized with cgb games issue\n20.10.2025:v0.79.02\n* performance improvement for cgb games\n18.10.2025:v0.79.00\n* added save message on menu entry if saving\n* increased audio volume effective range\n* added message when trying to change cgb to dmg/sgb colours\n* automatic cgb enhance used for pokemon yellow\n* dmg/sgb compatibility enabled\n* fixed crash on error\n17.10.2025:v0.78.40\n* improved audio quality\n15.10.2025:v0.78.38\n* some small improvement to entry of settings menu speed\n* added fixes for donkey kong land 2/3\n14.10.2025:v0,78.36\n*fixed sgb border behaviour when exiting an sgb enhanced game\n*fixed palette not resetting after game exit\n*removed savegame indicator when exiting a game and associated pause\n*autosave no longer triggered on setting menu return\n*increased swap speed.\n*removed audio clipping\n13.10.2025;v0.78.35\n*increased performance in all interlaced and non interlaced modes(will be an option in future but its a world of difference, no drops in pokemon menus, etc)\n*removed old settings from menu\n*more efficient use of 2nd core(bass boost temporarily disabled)\n*audio sampling rate increased\n12.10.2025:v0.78.31\n* fixed bug with cpu mode setting(increased responsiveness)\n* increased interlacing/interleaving speed\n* added sparse interlacing mode\n11.10.2025:v0.78.21\n* maximized file list generation speed.\n* improved exit game function, immediate now.\n10.10.2025:v0.78.20\n* added basic file/directory sorting functions(oversight from long ago finally corrected)\n* fixed file browsing bug after exiting a game\n* improved exit game function, smoother exit from menu\n09.10.2025:v0.78.10\n* Removed last usage of malloc in preparation for modularity\n* Updated cpu core, Final Fantasy Legends III among others now work as expected. \n* Updated to latest m5stack libraries, cardputer adv officially supported. End of adv testing phase.\n24.07.2024:0.78\n* Reduced overall volume; it still draws enough power to cause the backlight to flicker with the boost on full effect and volume maxed but it was flickering badly with the new amplification code.\n* Added revision number to boot sequence\n* Added configurable BASS BOOST to settings menu (0 -> +42db gain)\n* Removed dynamically allocated memory component for cartridge ram, 32k is largest any compatible game requires anyways so this is now a fixed buffer preventing memory fragmentation allowing for...\n* Added ability to quit the current game and return to the file selection menu; there may be a slight sound as the next game starts. This is just left over audio buffer info from the previous emulation.\n< spent time this month porting the emulator to T-Display S3 Touch ;gamepad support working in that version, this was research to hopefully discover the incompatibility the cardputer seems to be having >\n07.07.2024:\n* Added bass boost function to audio engine\n* Added SGB support for pocket bomberman\n* Improved audio dynamic range; less clipping at high volume levels.\n* Fix bug with startup audio being forced to Mute (part of BLE debugging code I forgot to remove)\n06.07.2024:v0.77\n* Added adventures of lolo, james bond 007, The Rescue of Princess Blobette Starring A Boy and His Blob, Game & Watch Gallery, Arcade Classics No2 Centipede and Millipede SGB & AP support\n* Increased speed of entering large directories in some circumstances\n* Increased file list limit to 1024 entries maximum, provided there is sufficient memory. Most files probably use less than half the max file name size, so 1024x128 directory entry listings are easily accommodated. File names may still be a full 256 bytes in length.\n29.06.2024:v0.76\n* Compatibiliyy mode settings now take effect immediately if changed mid-game; will display message if mode is locked on due to override requirement (ie: battlezone which requires it on for any functionality)\n* Button mapped to controller B and del/back button will return to a parent directory (if not at root)\n* Added CRT Television border available for all games\n* Added Star Wars: Super Return of the Jedi SGB & Ap support w/Border\n* Increased file/directory listing limit to 512 entries per directory\n* No longer crashes when there are too many files, will list first 512 files and display warning.\n* Added warning message when too many files/directories exist to list.\n25.06.2024:v0.75\n* Firmware now contains bootloader so it can be loaded without a launcher/direct from m5burner\n* Added SGP & AP support for Mega Man I/II and Mystic Quest\n* Added USB serial debug output to the entire function chain leading up to the main emulator loop. This should hopefully aid in helping debug games, and provide more comprehensive information for trouble shooting.\n* Added CPU mode to settings menu (CPU MODE: FAST/COMPATIBLE), defaults to fast. Enabled automatically for titles known to need this: Battlezone so far, will add any reported titles. For now it takes effect only upon restart of the emulator (will take effect immediately in future update). This disables all speed hacks,and forces rendering of every line of every frame.\n* BLE gamepad support only stable in file picker, causes restart during emulation so still disabled.\n* Fixed Minor bug with auto SGB mode flag setup\n24.06.2024:v0.74\n* Added compatibility mode that skips all speed hacks (skipped frames and unrenderd lines)\n* Added automatic compatibility mode override for titles that are identified to require this, as a result Battlezone is now compatible.\n* Added SGB support for Battlezone\n* Resolved BLE server and SD card conflict; this took about a week of research and debugging.\n20.05.2024:v0.73\n* BLE startup behaviour implemented, BLE sync from main menu implemented\n* Gamepad buttons a,b,x,y and d-pad directional control integrated\n19.05.2024:v0.72\n* Implemented Default Palette selection, SGB manual/auto selection and SGB border options\n* Added Default Palette, SGB palette manual/auto, SGB border manual/auto/gboy to options menu\n* Added BLE connect manual/auto, BLE button swap on/off (swaps a+b button mapping), BLE deadzone small/med/large for left-stick deadzone configuration\n* All new options are now saved in a new iteration of the config file, as usual, any previous config file will automatically migrate to the new version\n* BLE connection settings will be saved/loaded regardless of BLE compilation support for consistent configuration file layout\n18.05.2024:v0.71\n* Added SGB profiles for Alleyway, Baseball, Dr. Mario, Game Boy Wars, Kaeru no Tame, Kirbys Dream Land, Mario and Yoshi,Qix,Tennis,X,Yakyuman,Yoshi\n(note: not all of these are compatible, but it almost completes the built in SGB maps that were included in the SGB hardware; future core updates may improve compatibilty)\n* Added AP profiles for Alleyway, Baseball, Dr. Mario\n* Added bluetooth library to the emulator, this has a fairly substantial memory cost and will be disabled until ready for deployment; made inclusion of the BLE code optional when compiling.\n* Added initial hooks for gamepad support.\n12.06.2024:v0.70\n* Added per-game savestates (1 state/game in .qsv file), backspace to save, minus/underscore button to load\n* All borders are now drawn as RGB565 sprites; almost no impact for FPS display now\n* Borders now have a cooldown before changing, allowing the emulator to run smoothly when cycling options\n* Increased scroll speed in file selection menu\n* Changed number of file/directories displayed at once from 3 to 5\n* Added Dragon Warrior I & II SGB & AP support w/ Border\n* Added SGB border support for Pokemon Silver/Gold, SGB/AP colours temporarily set to exisiting pallets until better is found\n11.06.2024(pm):v0.68\n* Control A and Control Start will now also navigate into directories\n* Message Box constrast increased (darker background)\n* First item in subdirectories is selected (if anything is present) instead of return to parent directory option\n* Added Generic Fantasy Border (from a jp only SGB game) available to all games\n* Final Fantasy Legend II SGB * AP support (same as FFL1)\n* Added Metroid II SGB & AP support\n* Added Golf SGB & AP support\n* Added Solar Striker SGB & AP support\n* Added Missle Command/Asteroids SGB and AP support w/ border\n* Added Space Invaders SGB & SP support w/ Border\n11.06.2024(am):v0.67\n* Added ability to return to parent directory if it exists\n* Added ability to launch ROMs from other directories\n* Hides System Volume Information if in root directory; this is probably not what the user wants.\n10.06.2024:v0.66.5\n* Added memsub_malloc() and memsub_freeall() functions to allow paging memory to be used for other purposes:namely, file browsing.\n* Changed file_picker() function to use memsub_malloc() / memsub_freeall(), limits are as follows:\n256 files/folders per folder, maximum path+file length+3 letter extension is 256 bytes\nThere is no limit to the depth of the folders, except that the path name+file cannot exceed 256 bytes\nNo issue with long file names, the memsub_malloc() has 65k roughly allocated per directory listing, just be mindful of the overall path+filename length\n* Added *.gbc in addition to *.gb files to selection menu\n* Added directories to selection menu, can now explore subdirectories\n* Adjusted default SGB palettes for Pokemon Blue/Red; previous fix required adjustment of these two titles.\n09.06.2024:v0.66\n* Added Max and Min audio quality settings, 6 and 72 sample intervals respectively\n* Added 12 colour Analogue Pocket palette for Kirbys Pinball Land\n* Added 12 colour Analogue Pocket palette for Donkey Kong Land\n* Added SGB border and palette for Donkey Kong Land\n* Added Cardputer Arcade cabinet border, available for all games\n08.06.2024:\n* Silver has been tested, must rename to .gb from .gbc\n06.06.2024:v0.65\n* increased paged memory limit to 2megs to accommodate Pokemon Gold/Silver\n* Gold has been tested, must rename to .gb from .gbc\n* increased specificity of error messages regarding paging\n04.06.2024:v0.64\n* Fixed bug with setting initial super gameboy palettes\n* Added Pokemon Yellow SGB Border and AP Community Palette\n* Added Supermario land 2 SGB border\n* Added Tetris SGB border\n* Added Final Fantasy Legends SGB Palette and Border, added 12 colour Analogue Pocket palette\n* Pokemon Blue border is now scaled using simple pixel scaling method (same as all other borders) to preserve pixelized look\n* Gameboy border left border has been adjusted\n03.06.2024:v0.63\n* Added audio quality setting (high,med,low, update intervals of 12,24 and 36 audio samples)\n* Added startup audio volume setting (default is mute)\n* Added interlacing setting\n* Added new settings to configuration files; old configuration files are always supported, and will be upgraded to the newest version when the settings are saved for the first time.\n* Squished another bug; timed events weren't taking into account time for border drawing/clearing\n* Fixed crash from settings menu when accessed from main menu, settings are saved on game launch or if changed mid game. Crash was related to saving within the file picker.\n02.06.2024:v0.622\n* Added mute and volume half/max contols to Fn+Left/Right keys\n01.05.2024:v0.621\n* Experimented with an inline version of the ganeboy CPU its various functions but they yeilded no performance gain\n* CPU step loop moved inside of peanut_gb to reduce function calls, essentially the same as inline but with no memory penalty\n30.05.2024.v0.62\n* Audio rendering has been made faster updating every 24 by default samples, was twelve; 24 will be the default (a.k.a. medium quality) sligt reduction in quality when frame rate dips low can be noticed at 36; may make option for audio quality. Updating every 36 samples seems\nto be the minimum(clicking becomes more likely beyond this update interval), so 12,24,36 seem to be appropriate settings; every 12 sameples was used in 6.0 may added higher and lower quality settings in future\n* Adjusted TTL logic to run seperately from the page retrieval so that retrieving data is as fast as possible when in memory.\n29.05.2024:v0.61\n* Memory solution devised was based on two ideas: Assume stastically random access patterns, and place no limits on addressable space.\nThe reality is that the gameboy games never exceed 8megabits (1megabyte); Taking advantage of the limitations of the gameboy, I have removed the generalized nature of the\tprevious solution in favor of one that provides a deterministic approach to page seeking, with the tradeoff that no games larger than a real game boy game can be loaded any longer. This should not pose an issue for any (valid) title. This has increased frame rates slightly all around and made them much steadier; page location has no bearing on access times. Page seek times are fixed, and a minor amount of page maintenance is done at these intervals, distributed across successive calls still. This would be deterministic page seeking mixed with the previous progressive pruning.\n* Added Error messages with regards to writing save game files, attempts to do so when there is no cart ram\n* Added Error messages specific to the case of being unable to open a file vs. file size 0 (was ambiguous before)\n* Removed pause associated with automatic savegames; bars operate on a timer now and will disappear 1second after pending write is completed\n\n28.05.2024:v0.601\n* No longer will create save files or allow save files to be created for titles without cart ram(0b files no more)\n\n27.05.2024:v0.6\n* Audio is fully implemented. Inaccuratley, built for speed. Hardly any impact of rendering.\nNote: While the tones will not change pitch as a title slows down, music will speed up and slow down along with frame rates.\n* Implemented volume up/down controls attached to Fn+up/down arrows. If these are mapped to controls, at this time, it will respond to both.\nFurther Note: I put no limits on control configuration. Make everything a single button if you want.\n* Added cessation of audio rendering when volume is set to 0.\n26.05.2024:v0.57\n* alterered APU to allow variable amounts of time between calls\n* Tuned APU performance to get first recognizable gameplay sounds out of the emulator.\n25.05.2024:v0.56\n* Added 12color AP palette mapping for Links Awakening\n* Added SGB border for Pokemon Red\n* Added SGB border for Links Awakening\n* Added notification for titles with Analogue Pocket profile, but no SGB profile\n* Work on audio playback engine has begun, core 0 continusoly feeds audio from a buffer to the speaker; a test 1000hz sine wave shows little to no stuttering while emulator runs, needs tuning. Disabled until apu work complete.\n23.05.2024:v0.53\n* Required memory for pokemon +5k just incase has been made available\n* Implemented 12-color Analogue Pocket palettes for Pokemon Red/Blue\n* Implemented preset SGB and GBC palettes for Pokemon Red/Blue\n* Implemented SGB borders for Pokemon Blue\n* disabled audio for this release; exported to wav file to examine and while its the same code\nit is not generating the same output as the PC test version. Will take further research.\n22.05.2025:v0.52\n* Implemented audio with peanut_gb hooks on PC (version for debugging); verified APU core and waveforms\n* Integrated Audio with peanut_gb hooks on ESP32; audio waveforms are now being generated, needs balancing with CPU and speaker playback still\n\n21.05.2024:v0.51\n* implemented main emulator function as a task on core 1 and a second persistent task on core 0 via RTOS; this is in preparation to acommodate the APU engine\n* core 0 thread must call vTaskDelay as there are vital threads on that core, which if not attented to, will cause a restart. I dont have full use of this core.\n* discovered pokemon starts working if I have more free memory so I suspect I run out of stack space. 180k paging it works 200 it doesn't will calculate requied amount\n\n20.05.2024:v0.5\n* added bottom menu bar with instructions to the main rom selection menu, pres ESC or ' key (same thing) to enter the settings menu either from the main menu or while playing a game\n* added options menu, can be entered from the menu or from within a game; displays the 8 main controls with their current setting, saves settings when closed\n* added restore defaults for config menu\n* settings are saved to gbconfig.dat; delete this if you are having any issues\n\n19.05.2024:v0.492\n* Reimplemented memory subsystem to use progressive partial page seeking/pruning; the original memory management code was the first I had typed in 14 years; after some thought I devised something much more suitable for a real time environment. This resulted in the average page seek time being much lower, and distributes maintenance of the paging system across successive calls. The results are the largest improvement to speed to date. Over double the frame rates from before; less stutter, smoother page transitions in memory. Donkey Kong Land averages around 45fps now; Super Mario land 2 gets an average 53fps on the overworld.\n\n18.05.2024:v0.491\n* Reduced rendering workload 6.25% by modifying peanut_gb to inherently skip lines that aren't visible due to scaling.\nThis prevents the engine from having to process the layer and sprite data for these lines all together. Why 6.25%? because 9 lines are skipped which is 6.25% of the lines that were rendered previously.\n\n17.05.2024:v0.49 \n* Refactored graphics code; ~120,000 less operations a frame\n* Scrolling behaviour and screen content differences no longer effect rendering performance Titles such as final fantasy or even super mario land 2 show a huge improvement in overworld movement speed.\n\n17.05.2024: v0.483 Pushing this now as a BUG FIX RELEASE\n* Fixed bug in main menu causing selection to only move upward; you can now navigate properly again.\n* added FPS display while Fn button is held, causes slow down which is subtracted from the FPS display. This is so I can evaluate performance improvements more than anything else, but it doesn't hurt to have so I'm leaving it in.\n* new borders are on hold while I make decisions about the internal format (leaning towards argb1555,presently 565)\n16.05.2024: v0.482\n* Added Analogue Pocket 12color palette category with 44 palettes\n* Automatic 12color(AP) palettes mapped as per Analogue Pocket suggested mappings for:\n\tMario 1/2/Wario Land/Balloon Kid/F1 Race/Tetris\n* added Cottage Daytime SGB border\n* Fixed 12colours not being assigned until palette select bug\n* regularly mapped controller up/down/a now functions in addition to arrow/enter keys in main menu to allow a single hand posture for the entire interface if desired.\n\n15.05.2024: v0.481\n* proper DMG-01 startup sequence, may help compatibility with some games.\n* Message boxes now will display any emulation errors reported by peanut_gb\n* Attempts to access ROM address outside of the available cartridge ROM will display an appropriate message\n\n14.05.2024 v0.48 Added 12 colour mode, with the 12 palettes the game boy colour could apply to old game boy games as the first of this mode, but more to come in this area.\n*Super gameboy support added for screen borders with gameboy skin set as default, followed by 1 (for now) of the official borders from the hardware itself. Activate by holding Fn and pressing '[' and cycle borders by holding Fn and pressing ']'. Because these are the same keys used for other visual modifications, I hope using the combination of Fn and these keys is intuitive.\n* Super gameboy palette support added for balloon kid, the legend of zelda links awakening and kirbys pinball land\n* Various other small tweaks you probably wont notice.\n\n12.06.2025 V0.47 Added first iteration of Super Gameboy Mode with all 32 official palettes that were included with the original hardware. Nintendo included a table on the device to map certain games to certain palettes, and that functionality is partially implemented. Mario 1/2/Wario Land, F1 Racer and Tetris all autodetect and assign their colour scheme. This mode can be toggled on and off at any time during play with the '[' button, and the current cycle palette button will cycle through the 32 included palettes. Games with defined profiles with start with that palette selected automatically when Super Gameboy Mode is engaged for the first time each session. \n*Lots of user interface changes; message boxes will appear to describe your palette selections, among other things - no console style debug remains in normal operation.\n*Another 4k of memory allocated to ROM storage, may smooth out some edge cases of stuttering.\n*Improved readability in the main menu; and made highlighted selection more apparent.\n*Added smooth transitions to splash screen.\n*Disabled unused (for the moment) configuration file\n\n11,05.2024:: 0.44 squished a bug, added palette control, press ']' to cycle between presets.\nb/w, gameboy(original), gameboy pocket and gameboy light (in that order).\nHuge performance improvements for larger ROMs with over 110k more ram available to the memory sub-system. Palette values are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes for accuracy.\n\n10.05.2024:: 0.41 added savegame support. if a game uses it's onboard ram constantly though, use the manual backup button (=). The save feature will only automatically engage after the cartridge ram has been left untouched for a second.\n\nYellow bars on either side of the display momentarily indicate that the cartridge ram has been backed up. The savegame format will not be changing, its a simple binary dump.\n\nControls(in game):\nleft/right use 'a' and 'd'\nup/down use 'e' and 's'\nA/B use 'l' and 'k'\nstart/select use '1' and '0'\ncycle palette in current mode use the ] square bracket\ncycle between classic gameboy,super gameboy & 12 color modes [\nquicksave/savestate press del/backspace key\nquickload/loadstate press minus/underscore key\nforce cart ram backup  press '=' (if uncertain of gamesave use this)\nturn on super gameboy border at any time by pressing Fn+'['\ncycle through border options by pressing Fn+']'\nDisplay current FPS by holding Fn; it will appear in 1 second and update every second there after, can cause some slowdown but that is accounted for in the FPS count.\nPress `/esc in the main menu or during gameplay for settings menu\nMute audio using Fn+left arrow\nRaise audio to 50% then 100% using Fn+right arrow\nChange volume using Fn+up/down arrow keys for granular control\n\nHave fun!",

It reads accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, battery, and button states, showing them on the device screen. It supports WiFi client mode and AP configuration mode.\n\nQuick Setup:\n\nPower on the device; if no WiFi is saved, it starts in AP mode.\n\nConnect to the AP GuinomoAPI-Config (password: guinomoadmin).\n\nOpen http://192.168.4.1/setup in a browser.\n\nEnter your WiFi SSID and password, then click Save and Connect.\n\nDevice restarts and connects automatically.\n\nAccess endpoints like /api/sensors, /api/gyro, /api/accel, and /api/buttons to get JSON data. Ideal for IoT experiments, prototyping, or building sensor-based applications. Configuration is saved persistently for quick reconnection after restarts. Lightweight, efficient, and fully interactive, made by a Brazilian <3.",

    "description": "See: https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4759435067747297899/3827130560033440934\nThis software is for the M5 Cardputer (original, but should work on the \u201cadvanced\u201d model) and is an environmental monitoring system, saving data to an SD card and displaying it nicely on a webpage.\n\nThis software is for the M5 Cardputer (original, but should work on the \u201cadvanced\u201d model) and is an environmental monitoring system, saving data to an SD card and displaying it nicely on a webpage.\n\nIt uses the BME 680 sensor, connected via the I2C for remote environmental monitoring. The cardputer is set up as a Webserver so that current readings can be seen on a webpage.\n\nThis software project is unfinished, but all the main features work well and survive a 24 hour soak test. I hope others can build on it! The code is weakly commented, but I hope it is readable.\n\nReadings of pressure, temp and humidity are taken every minute (frequency not currently configurable) and saved in memory and to a CSV file, stored on the SD card, if one is present. The file is named based on the current date and a new CSV file is created at midnight.\n\nOn the home page, you can click the \u201cData and Charts\u201d button which will allow you to view the last 24 hours of data and adjust the viewing start and end times for a nice graphical display.\n\nAny CSV files saved on the SD card can be downloaded to your local machine.\n\nAnother page allows you to configure operational parameters for high and low alarms for temperature, pressure and humidity. An alarm sound is played from a WAV file through the cardputer\u2019s speaker and an indication of the alarm is given on the home page.\n\nThe Cardputer\u2019s display can show each of the environmental values in turn when you press any key, along with the device\u2019s IP address on the network, once it is connected. The local time is determined by connecting to an NTP server.\n\nThe code is built from various examples given on the M5Stack website and forums as well as some other places.\n\nThe cardputer software uses 2 HTML files from the root folder of the SD card \u2013 \u201cindex.html\u201d and \u201ccharts without data.html\u201d These have placeholders for various bits of data such that the cardputer software fills them in with the relevant data. The chart data stored in memory is sent as a Javascript array so that the web page, when rendered, shows all the chart data. The chart display code was written by Chatgpt and modified a little to produce the relevant display, with start and end time zoom sliders!\n\nI hope someone uses it to monitor their greenhouse or something!\n\nOf course, you can set up port forwarding on your router and keep an eye on your greenhouse remotely!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAndrew Johnson Dec 2025",

    "description": "THIS IS VERY EASY... AND FREE! For M5StickC Plus2 Only!\nM5GroqBot requires a free Groq API key to function. This guide will walk you through getting your key and configuring your device.\n-Step 1: Get Your Free API Key\n-Create a Groq Account\n-Open your web browser on your computer or phone\n-Navigate to the Groq Console:\nhttps://console.groq.com/keys\n-Sign up for a new Groq account (or log in if you already have one)\n-The free tier is automatically available upon sign-up\n-No credit card required\n-Generous free usage limits\n-Generate Your API Key\n-Once logged in, you'll see the API Keys page\n-Click the \"Create API Key\" button\n-Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., M5GroqBot or M5StickC-Voice)\n-Click \"Create\"\n-\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: Copy the key immediately!\n-The key looks like: gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n>>>You won't be able to see it again after closing the dialog<<<\n-Store it somewhere safe \n\n-Step 2: Flash Firmware to Your Device\n-Step 3: Connect to Device WiFi Access Point\n-After the firmware is flashed and the device restarts:\n\n-Look at the M5StickC screen - it should display:\n\nWiFi Setup...\nConnect to:\nM5GroqBot-Setup\nOn your phone or computer:\n\nOpen WiFi settings\nLook for network named: M5GroqBot-Setup\nConnect to it (no password required, if it does ask, it was groqbot123)\nWait for setup page to open automatically\n\nIf it doesn't auto-open, manually go to: http://192.168.4.1\nStep 4: Configure WiFi and API Key\nOn the setup page you'll see:\n\nWiFi Network dropdown\n\nSelect your home/office WiFi network\nEnter the WiFi password\nGroq API Key field\n\nPaste your Groq API key here (the one you copied earlier)\nMake sure there are no extra spaces before or after\nClick \"Save\"\n\nDevice will save settings and restart\nTakes about 5-10 seconds\nStep 5: First Use\nAfter restart, the device will:\n\nConnect to your WiFi automatically\n\nDisplays the ready screen:\n\nREADY!\nAsk me anything\nWith simple animation!\n\nPress M5 Button to start recording\nSpeak your question clearly for 3 seconds\nGet instant AI responses!\nScroll down by pressing the PWR button or bottom button\nScroll up by pressing R or top button\nHOLD R to change colors of CHAT. \n\n\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW.  Work in progress. I will probably update this project... Updated from 2 to 3 seconds recording. Color change settings now stay after reboot.  \nI was STILL unable to get it to \"continue\" back to back questions. So what happens is when you ask a question it will prompt to reinitialize, after scrolling down, it takes just a few seconds to reconnect, its a little annoying. By pressing down just saves you the time of it not recording and then failing and rebooting. If you try to ask it another question it WILL also reconnect, it just takes longer and is a bit confusing as... it should work. \nI am going to still try to fix it. \n It does not affect the way the chatbot works. It's one question at a time and NO memory at all.\n IF you do not speak clearly it may not do anything when it tries to translate, if it says ERROR Parse Failed it did not hear you.  I think the groq free tier is 30 request per hour. I have not maxed it out testing yet and have done a lot of testing. \n\nHave fun. \n\nCreated by Coreymillia\n",

SNTP clock and stopwatch \n2. Integrated radio in the firmware with the ability to play radio in the background when pressing HOME (G0), press ESC to fully exit. \n3. Display battery voltage, current, and free heap size, adding a real feature to the WiFi icon \n4. A functional text editor that saves the file to the SD card.\n\nFurther down the line, I'll be adding more applications.\nStill in development... More updates for the project coming soon!",

    "description": "A friendly unit for those lonely Pwnagotchis out there. It's written to run on the M5 Atom S3(R) Dev Kit.\n\nThis is a fork of viniciusbo's Palnagotchi for the M5 Cardputer.\n\nHe reverse engineered the Pwngrid advertisement protocol and made it possible for the Cardputer to advertise to the Pwngrid as a Pwnagotchi. All brain policy parameters that could negatively impact AI learning were removed from the advertisemenet data.\n\nThe Pwngrid works by sending Wifi beacon frames with a JSON serialized payload in Wifi AC headers, containing the Pwnagotchi's data (name, face, pwns, brain policy between others). That's how nearby Pwnagotchis can detect and also learn each other. By crafting a custom beacon frame, this app can appear as a Pwnagotchi to other Pwnagotchis.\n",

    "description": "speedometer for a bicycle, motorcycle, etc. based on a Hall sensor\n\n1. Required components:\nM5StickC Plus 2: The device itself.\nHall sensor: For example, KY-024 (linear) or KY-003 (digital). For a speedometer, a digital sensor is better, which produces a clear HIGH/LOW signal when a magnet is detected.\nMagnet: A neodymium magnet that will be attached to the wheel.\nConnecting wires.\nGrove cable (optional): If you are using the Grove port of the M5StickC Plus 2.\n2. Connecting the Hall sensor:\nThe M5StickC Plus 2 has several available GPIO. We will use one of them.\n\nVCC (power) of the Hall sensor -> 5V or 3.3V on the M5StickC Plus 2 (check the specification of your sensor).\nGND (ground) of the Hall sensor -> GND on the M5StickC Plus 2.\nOUT (signal pin) of the Hall sensor -> GPIO 32 on the M5StickC Plus 2. (GPIO 32 is available on the Grove port as SDA, but it can be used as a regular GPIO).\n\n**Important:** Make sure that your Hall sensor produces a signal level compatible with the 3.3V logic of the ESP32. Most digital Hall sensors have a built-in comparator and work with 3.3V. If you have a 5V sensor, you may need a voltage divider on the signal line, but this is usually not necessary as the ESP32 is tolerant of 5V inputs up to a certain threshold.",

    "description": "Scorched Earth M5 - Artillery Game\nA turn-based artillery game for the M5StickC Plus2, featuring destructible terrain and tetrimino-styled graphics.\n\nOverview\nScorchedM5 is a Scorched Earth-style artillery game where you face off against an AI opponent. Both players control upside-down T-shaped tetrimino tanks positioned on randomly generated destructible terrain. Take turns adjusting your angle and power to fire projectiles across the map and destroy your opponent.\n\nFeatures\nDestructible Terrain: Randomly generated landscapes with smooth terrain profiles\nTurn-based Combat: Adjust angle and power, then fire at your opponent\nPhysics-based Projectiles: Realistic arc trajectory with gravity\nAI Opponent: Computer-controlled enemy with randomized but strategic firing\nAnimated Sky: Scrolling clouds and tetrimino birds add atmosphere\nWin/Loss Tracking: Keep track of your victories and defeats\nTetris-themed Graphics\nControls\nM5StickC Plus2 Buttons:\nLeft Button (PWR): Decrease angle (move aim left)\nRight Button (BtnB): Increase angle (move aim right)\nM5 (BtnA): Cycle power (1-100%, hold to reverse direction)\nRight Button: Fire projectile\n\nGameplay:\nIN THIS ORDER!\n1.Adjust your firing angle using Left/Right buttons (in 2.5% increments)\n2.Set your power level using M5 button (in 2.5% increments) \nHold M5 to go in lower increments, press M5 to raise it. \n3.Then press Right button to fire\n\nWatch the projectile arc across the screen\nAI takes its turn automatically\nFirst to destroy opponent's tank wins!\n\nGame Mechanics\nTerrain Generation\nRandomly generated smooth terrain using sine wave patterns\nDifferent heights and profiles each game\nFully destructible - blocks removed by explosions\nTank Placement\nTanks spawn on opposite sides of the terrain\nAlways on solid ground\nRandom horizontal positions each game\nProjectile Physics\nGravity affects trajectory\nAngle range: adjustable via buttons\nPower range: 1-100%\nExplosion radius removes terrain blocks\nAI Behavior\nCalculates approximate trajectory to player\nAdds randomization to power and angle\nBecomes more accurate as game progresses\nAvoids shooting directly off-screen\nWin Conditions\nDestroy opponent's tank with direct hit\nTrack wins and losses across multiple rounds\nTerrain collapses are visual only (tanks don't fall)\nCredits\n\nPart of the Tetrimino game series for M5StickC Plus2:\n\nTetriminos - Space Invaders variant\nTetriSnake - Snake with tetrimino obstacles\nScorchedM5 - Artillery combat (this project)\nTetroidsM5 - Asteroids meets Tetris\n\nI remembered playing this as a kid. Could not remember the name so it was built from memory. But there are a lot of similar ones like Scorched Earth. \n\nColors are MUCH better than my gif here.  \n\nCreated by Coreymillia",

    "description": "TETRIS! MULTI-PLAYER!\n\n*There is still a single player mode!\n\nThis project represents a significant evolution from a single-player M5StickC Plus2 Tetris game to a full-featured 2-player battle system. While built upon AleksAlcDel's excellent foundation and inspired by Hexagon's advanced concepts, the battle system, enhanced features, and professional polish represent substantial original contribution to the M5Stack Tetris Community. \n\n*REQUIRES Mini JoyC Hat!\n-Multi-Player *Requires 2nd M5StickC Plus2\nTO CONNECT- After booting opening screen. First hold down on the JoyC Hat. Then WAIT! about 15-20 seconds and it will create a hotspot. Shortly afterward hold down on JoyC hat on 2nd M5Stick, it will connect quickly. They are supposed to ready up together. Sometimes they do. Sometimes one person opens a few seconds earlier. No matter what the game syncs up and the battle begins. I would however not delay a long time after connecting to each other to ready up.\n\n-20 Levels\n-Ghost Piece\n-Next Piece  *only displays for a second. Not intentional. \n-Border- to fill the void on the original\n-A battle meter! I don't actually know what this does. \n-You can each select your own levels! For multi skill level users. \n-GARBAGE! Clearing. 2 Lines sends ,  3 lines sends 2 and 4 lines sends 4! I was going to make T-spins send 4. But its really not fair, as they are so easy. \n-Press Left button for hold next piece!\n-M5 pauses it game\n*note: pausing one game does NOT pause the other\n\n-Progressive lock delay! I think it works. not a huge fan of slow speeds, so I really only could tell on the higher level. But its set to go from 450 ms to 650ms at Max level. \n-There is also a left over WiFi monitor hold up... and Tetris beacon on the opening screen if you hold L+R. So. Don't do that unless you want the world to know someone is playing Tetris nearby. \n\nOnly for M5StickC Plus2\n\nCreated by Coreymillia\n",

Unlike standard visualizers that only show graphics on the device's screen, this firmware also contains a Web Server. It captures raw audio from the built-in microphone, processes it, and streams the raw PCM data over WiFi to any connected client (Smartphone, PC, Tablet) along with serving basic visualization webapps.\n\n",

    "description": "This firmware is a demonstration firmware for the ULSA M5B, an ultrasonic anemometer that can stack with the M5Stack Core2.\nIt provides a wind speed and direction gauge, as well as a wind direction correction feature using the Bosch 9-axis sensor BNO055 built into the ULSA.\nThis firmware is compatible with Core2, Core2 for AWS, and Core2 V1.1.\n\n[Version 2.2 - 2025/10/21]\n - Added support for FAT16 file count limitation\n - Fixed BLE device name bug\n - Improved stability for long-term operation\n\n[Version 2.1 - 2025/09/28]\n - Fixed a bug where, depending on SD card compatibility, log files could suffer data loss or be created as empty files.\n\n - Changed the logging method to output in 15-minute segments instead of a single file.\n\n - Implemented an external-power-only mode (\u201cEXT\u201d). When the ULSA is powered via the device\u2019s micro-B port, charging of the internal battery is disabled. This prevents unexpected reboots caused by conflicts between charging and discharging of the internal battery. Tap the battery icon to switch to EXT mode.\n\n[Version 2.0 - 2024/08/04]\n\n - Supports BLE wireless connection\n - Supports automatic time synchronization via BLE (syncs with the built-in RTC)\n - Supports CSV data logging to an SD card\n\nBy accessing the ULSA BLE site using the Web Bluetooth API (https://strvsn.net/P5/ULSA_BLE/), wireless measurement and wireless logging via the browser are possible.\n\nSupported browsers:\nPC: Chrome, Edge\nAndroid: Chrome\niOS: Bluefy (logging function not supported)",

It can sniff, store, replay, dump and monitor most 433Mhz (currently ASK-OOK only) signals. These include garage door openers, remote doorbells, sensors and similar devices.\n\nThe core of this project aims to be its simplicity, reliability and versatility. With a couple of ICs and a by 'connecting some wires', or soldering a breakout board, one can start messing around with 433Mhz devices and decode their communications protocols. It's mainly a proof-of-concept but already encompasses several very useful features.",

    "description": "This software is part of the integrated training developed by Julio Della Flora (@juliodellaflora on Instagram) and is designed to assist hardware hackers in discovering and interacting with UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) serial ports on embedded devices using an M5Stack device. The program allows users to toggle between various common UART baud rates, enabling communication with different serial devices. It also sends commands like \"help\" via the UART connection to test responses and displays the received data in real-time on the M5Stack's screen.\n\nThe baud rates supported include 9600, 115200, 230400, 256000, 512000, and 921600. The tool logs all UART activity, saving the logs to an SD card for later review. Additionally, the M5Stack\u2019s screen displays real-time status, such as the battery level, and logs are printed on the screen as data is received. The software uses buttons to switch baud rates and trigger data transmission, making it an intuitive interface for exploring UART connections in embedded devices.\n\nThis software is part of the free training developed by Julio Della Flora (@juliodellaflora on Instagram), and you can check out the full training at the following link",

    "description": "It is a 24-hour clock for employees or managers of import/export companies, and those who work in trade clerical work.\n\nThe analog clock shows Greenwich Mean Time and the digital clock shows the three major markets of the world:New York,London and Tokyo. The clock face(background) displays the trading hours of each country's market and a map centered on the North Pole.(The hour hand(short hand) indicates the position of the sun.)\nIt seems that there is still no world clock that integrates these four elements and displays them. There is no complexity at all, rather it is intuitive to see and understand, and it greatly helps you to image the local time and trading situation of each market around the world.\n\nLocal time is displayed at the right of the clock face, and rate of 4 major currencies(3 currency pairs) are displayed in real time.\nThe LED on the side changes color according to market fluctuations(green\u2192orange\u2192red). Even if you don't pay attention to the rate numbers all the time, it is possible to grasp the mood of the market.\nIn addition, the world clock automatically switches between standard time, daylight saving time, and trading time display for each country's market under the following conditions.\n\nSecond Sunday in March: New York, Toronto, Chicago. Transition to daylight saving time.\nLast Sunday in March: London, Zurich, Frankfurt. Transition to daylight saving time.\nFirst Sunday in April: Wellington, Sydney. Transition to standard time.\nLast Sunday in September: Wellington. Transition to dylight saving time.\nLast Sunday in October: London, Zurich, Frankfurt. Transition to standard time.\nFirst Sunday in November: New York, Toronto, Chicago. Transition to standard time.\n\nThere is also a normal world clock mode that does not display currency rates, and a local time display mode (used when setting local time).\n\nRequires an SD card. Also download the clock face image ZIP on github.\nA detailed explanation is also written on github.\n\n\n0.0.5 : Made available in core2 V1.1\n0.0.6 : Shortened exchange rate acquisition interval from 10 seconds to 5 seconds",
